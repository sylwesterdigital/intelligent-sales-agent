our users have generated $1M+ with cold DMS

these are the three scripts that perform the BEST for our users:

SCRIPT 1: THE PROBLEM DIG ($180k attributed)

"hey [name] i see you're doing [thing] manually - how long does that take daily?"

[wait for time response]

"what if you could do it in 5 minutes instead?"

[share specific solution]

"want me to show you how [similar company] did it?"

WHY IT WORKS:

in a sales cycle, you always need to quantify pain before pitching a solution

in this script, they’re giving you the pain and the effort they’re going through firsthand

SCRIPT 2: THE COMPETITOR WEDGE ($120k attributed)

"saw you mentioned issues with [competitor] - which specific part is failing?"

[wait for specific problem]

"yeah that's why [customer] switched to us. [specific feature] solves that exact issue"

"want to see how it handles your use case?"

WHY IT WORKS:

enters through existing pain, not a cold pitch

SCRIPT 3: THE SOCIAL PROOF CLOSE ($90k attributed)

"hey noticed you're in [specific niche] - we just helped [similar company] increase [metric] by [specific percentage]"

"they had the same [specific problem you mentioned]"

"happy to share what worked if interested"

WHY IT WORKS: 

shows instead of tells

the meta pattern:

• acknowledge specific situation
• quantify problem or opportunity
• offer clear next step

never:

• start with "how are you"
• mention your product in first message
• use templates without customization

these scripts are built into @.inboxapp now but the framework is what matters

specificity + proof + clear action = money

everything else is noise
